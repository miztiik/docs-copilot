# Migrate .NET apps from the in-process model to the isolated worker model

This article walks you through the process of safely migrating your .NET function app from the [in-process model](./functions-dotnet-class-library.md) to the [isolated worker model][isolated-guide]. To learn about the high-level differences between these models, see the [execution mode comparison](./dotnet-isolated-in-process-differences.md).

This guide assumes that your app is running on version 4.x of the Functions runtime. If not, you should instead follow the guides for upgrading your host version:

- [Migrate apps from Azure Functions version 2.x and 3.x to version 4.x](./migrate-version-3-version-4.md)
- [Migrate apps from Azure Functions version 1.x to version 4.x](./migrate-version-1-version-4.md)

These host version migration guides will also help you migrate to the isolated worker model as you work through them.

## Identify function apps to upgrade

Use the following Azure PowerShell script to generate a list of function apps in your subscription that currently use the in-process model.

The script uses subscription that Azure PowerShell is currently configured to use. You can change the subscription by first running `Set-AzContext -Subscription '<YOUR SUBSCRIPTION ID>'` and replacing `<YOUR SUBSCRIPTION ID>` with the ID of the subscription you would like to evaluate.

```azurepowershell-interactive
$FunctionApps = Get-AzFunctionApp

$AppInfo = @{}

foreach ($App in $FunctionApps)
{
     if ($App.Runtime -eq 'dotnet')
     {
          $AppInfo.Add($App.Name, $App.Runtime)
     }
}

$AppInfo
```

## Choose your target .NET version

On version 4.x of the Functions runtime, your .NET function app targets .NET 6 when using the in-process model.

[!INCLUDE [functions-dotnet-migrate-v4-versions](../../includes/functions-dotnet-migrate-v4-versions.md)]

> [!TIP]
> **We recommend upgrading to .NET 8 on the isolated worker model.** This provides a quick upgrade path to the fully released version with the longest support window from .NET.

This guide doesn't present specific examples for .NET 7 or .NET 6. If you need to target these versions, you can adapt the .NET 8 examples.

## Prepare for migration

If you haven't already, identify the list of apps that need to be migrated in your current Azure Subscription by using the [Azure PowerShell](#identify-function-apps-to-upgrade).

Before you upgrade an app to the isolated worker model, you should thoroughly review the contents of this guide and familiarize yourself with the features of the [isolated worker model][isolated-guide] and the [differences between the two models](./dotnet-isolated-in-process-differences.md).

To upgrade the application, you will:

1. Complete the steps in [Upgrade your local project](#upgrade-your-local-project) to migrate your local project to the isolated worker model.
1. After migrating your project, fully test the app locally using version 4.x of the [Azure Functions Core Tools](functions-run-local.md). 
1. [Upgrade your function app in Azure](#upgrade-your-function-app-in-azure) to the isolated model.

## Upgrade your local project

The section outlines the various changes that you need to make to your local project to move it to the isolated worker model. Some of the steps change based on your target version of .NET. Use the tabs to select the instructions which match your desired version. These steps assume a local C# project, and if your app is instead using C# script (`.csx` files), you should [convert to the project model](./functions-reference-csharp.md#convert-a-c-script-app-to-a-c-project) before continuing.

> [!TIP]
> If you are moving to an LTS or STS version of .NET, the [.NET Upgrade Assistant] can be used to automatically make many of the changes mentioned in the following sections.

First, you'll convert the project file and update your dependencies. As you do, you will see build errors for the project. In subsequent steps, you'll make the corresponding changes to remove these errors.

### .csproj file

The following example is a `.csproj` project file that uses .NET 6 on version 4.x:

```xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">
  <PropertyGroup>
    <TargetFramework>net6.0</TargetFramework>
    <AzureFunctionsVersion>v4</AzureFunctionsVersion>
    <RootNamespace>My.Namespace</RootNamespace>
  </PropertyGroup>
  <ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Functions" Version="4.1.1" />
  </ItemGroup>
  <ItemGroup>
    <None Update="host.json">
      <CopyToOutputDirectory>PreserveNewest</CopyToOutputDirectory>
    </None>
    <None Update="local.settings.json">
      <CopyToOutputDirectory>PreserveNewest</CopyToOutputDirectory>
      <CopyToPublishDirectory>Never</CopyToPublishDirectory>
    </None>
  </ItemGroup>
</Project>
```

Use one of the following procedures to update this XML file to run in the isolated worker model:

# [.NET 8](#tab/net8)

[!INCLUDE [functions-dotnet-migrate-project-v4-isolated-net8](../../includes/functions-dotnet-migrate-project-v4-isolated-net8.md)]

# [.NET Framework 4.8](#tab/netframework48)

[!INCLUDE [functions-dotnet-migrate-project-v4-isolated-net-framework](../../includes/functions-dotnet-migrate-project-v4-isolated-net-framework.md)]

---

### Package references

 When migrating to the isolated worker model, you need to change the packages your application references.

[!INCLUDE [functions-dotnet-migrate-packages-v4-isolated](../../includes/functions-dotnet-migrate-packages-v4-isolated.md)]

### Program.cs file

When migrating to run in an isolated worker process, you must add a `Program.cs` file to your project with the following contents:

# [.NET 8](#tab/net8)

```csharp
using Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker;
using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting;

var host = new HostBuilder()
    .ConfigureFunctionsWebApplication()
    .ConfigureServices(services => {
        services.AddApplicationInsightsTelemetryWorkerService();
        services.ConfigureFunctionsApplicationInsights();
    })
    .Build();

host.Run();
```

This examples supports [ASP.NET Core integration] to use normal .NET 8 types. To use the built-in Functions HTTP types instead, replace the call to `ConfigureFunctionsWebApplication` with a call to `ConfigureFunctionsWorkerDefaults`.

# [.NET Framework 4.8](#tab/netframework48)

```csharp
using Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting;
using Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker;

namespace Company.FunctionApp
{
    internal class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            FunctionsDebugger.Enable();

            var host = new HostBuilder()
                .ConfigureFunctionsWorkerDefaults()
                .ConfigureServices(services => {
                    services.AddApplicationInsightsTelemetryWorkerService();
                    services.ConfigureFunctionsApplicationInsights();
                })
                .Build();
            host.Run();
        }
    }
}
```

---

The `Program.cs` file will replace any file that has the `FunctionsStartup` attribute, which is typically a `Startup.cs` file. In places where your `FunctionsStartup` code would reference `IFunctionsHostBuilder.Services`, you can instead add statements within the `.ConfigureServices()` method of the `HostBuilder` in your `Program.cs`. To learn more about working with `Program.cs`, see [Start-up and configuration](./dotnet-isolated-process-guide.md#start-up-and-configuration) in the isolated worker model guide.

Once you have moved everything from any existing `FunctionsStartup` to the `Program.cs` file, you can delete the `FunctionsStartup` attribute and the class it was applied to.

### Function signature changes

Some key types change between the in-process model and the isolated worker model. Many of these relate to the attributes, parameters, and return types that make up the function signature. For each of your functions, you must make changes to:

- The function attribute (which also sets the function's name)
- How the function obtains an `ILogger`/`ILogger<T>`
- Trigger and binding attributes and parameters

The rest of this section will walk you through each of these steps.

#### Function attributes

The `FunctionName` attribute is replaced by the `Function` attribute in the isolated worker model. The new attribute has the same signature, and the only difference is in the name. You can therefore just perform a string replacement across your project.

#### Logging

In the in-process model, you could include an additional `ILogger` parameter to your function, or you could use dependency injection to get an `ILogger<T>`. If you were already using dependency injection, the same mechanisms work in the isolated worker model.

However, for any Functions that relied on the `ILogger` method parameter, you will need to make a change. It is recommended that you use dependency injection to obtain an `ILogger<T>`.  Use the following steps to migrate the function's logging mechanism:

1. In your function class, add a `private readonly ILogger<MyFunction> _logger;` property, replacing `MyFunction` with the name of your function class.
1. Create a constructor for your function class that takes in the `ILogger<T>` as a parameter:

    ```csharp
    public MyFunction(ILogger<MyFunction> logger) {
        _logger = logger;
    }
    ```

    Replace both instances of `MyFunction` in the code snippet above with the name of your function class.

1. For logging operations in your function code, replace references to the `ILogger` parameter with `_logger`.
1. Remove the `ILogger` parameter from your function signature.

To learn more, see [Logging in the isolated worker model](./dotnet-isolated-process-guide.md#logging).

#### Trigger and binding changes

When you [changed your package references in a previous step](#package-references), you introduced errors for your triggers and bindings that you will now fix:

1. Remove any `using Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs;` statements.
1. Add a `using Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker;` statement.
1. For each binding attribute, change the attribute's name as specified in its reference documentation, which you can find in the [Supported bindings](./functions-triggers-bindings.md#supported-bindings) index. In general, the attribute names change as follows:

    - **Triggers typically remain named the same way.** For example, `QueueTrigger` is the attribute name for both models.
    - **Input bindings typically need "Input" added to their name.** For example, if you used the `CosmosDB` input binding attribute in the in-process model, this would now be `CosmosDBInput`.
    - **Output bindings typically need "Output" added to their name.** For example, if you used the `Queue` output binding attribute in the in-process model, this would now be `QueueOutput`.
 
1. Update the attribute parameters to reflect the isolated worker model version, as specified in the binding's reference documentation. 

    For example, in the in-process model, a blob output binding is represented by a `[Blob(...)]` attribute that includes an `Access` property. In the isolated worker model, the blob output attribute would be `[BlobOutput(...)]`. The binding no longer requires the `Access` property, so that parameter can be removed. So `[Blob("sample-images-sm/{fileName}", FileAccess.Write, Connection = "MyStorageConnection")]` would become `[BlobOutput("sample-images-sm/{fileName}", Connection = "MyStorageConnection")]`.

1. Move output bindings out of the function parameter list. If you have just one output binding, you can apply this to the return type of the function. If you have multiple outputs, create a new class with properties for each output, and apply the attributes to those properties. To learn more, see [Multiple output bindings](./dotnet-isolated-process-guide.md#multiple-output-bindings).

1. Consult each binding's reference documentation for the types it allows you to bind to. In some cases, you might need to change the type. For output bindings, if the in-process model version used an `IAsyncCollector<T>`, you can replace this with binding to an array of the target type: `T[]`. You can also consider replacing the output binding with a client object for the service it represents, either as the binding type for an input binding if available, or by [injecting a client yourself](./dotnet-isolated-process-guide.md#register-azure-clients).

1. If your function includes an `IBinder` parameter, remove it. Replace the functionality with a client object for the service it represents, either as the binding type for an input binding if available, or by [injecting a client yourself](./dotnet-isolated-process-guide.md#register-azure-clients).

1. Update the function code to work with any new types.

### local.settings.json file

The local.settings.json file is only used when running locally. For information, see [Local settings file](functions-develop-local.md#local-settings-file). 

When migrating from running in-process to running in an isolated worker process, you need to change the `FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME` value to "dotnet-isolated". Make sure that your local.settings.json file has at least the following elements:

```json
{
    "IsEncrypted": false,
    "Values": {
        "AzureWebJobsStorage": "UseDevelopmentStorage=true",
        "FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME": "dotnet-isolated"
    }
}
```

The value you have configured for `AzureWebJobsStorage`` might be different. You do not need to change its value as part of the migration.

### Example function migrations

#### HTTP trigger example

An HTTP trigger for the in-process model might look like the following example:

```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs;
using Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.Http;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;

namespace Company.Function
{
    public static class HttpTriggerCSharp
    {
        [FunctionName("HttpTriggerCSharp")]
        public static IActionResult Run(
            [HttpTrigger(AuthorizationLevel.Function, "get", Route = null)] HttpRequest req,
            ILogger log)
        {
            log.LogInformation("C# HTTP trigger function processed a request.");

            return new OkObjectResult($"Welcome to Azure Functions, {req.Query["name"]}!");
        }
    }
}
```

An HTTP trigger for the migrated version might like the following example:

# [.NET 8](#tab/net8)

```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;

namespace Company.Function
{
    public class HttpTriggerCSharp
    {
        private readonly ILogger<HttpTriggerCSharp> _logger;

        public HttpTriggerCSharp(ILogger<HttpTriggerCSharp> logger)
        {
            _logger = logger;
        }

        [Function("HttpTriggerCSharp")]
        public IActionResult Run(
            [HttpTrigger(AuthorizationLevel.Function, "get")] HttpRequest req)
        {
            _logger.LogInformation("C# HTTP trigger function processed a request.");

            return new OkObjectResult($"Welcome to Azure Functions, {req.Query["name"]}!");
        }
    }
}
```

# [.NET Framework 4.8](#tab/netframework48)

```csharp
using Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker;
using Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Http;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;
using System.Net;

namespace Company.Function
{
    public class HttpTriggerCSharp
    {
        private readonly ILogger<HttpTriggerCSharp> _logger;

        public HttpTriggerCSharp(ILogger<HttpTriggerCSharp> logger)
        {
            _logger = logger;
        }

        [Function("HttpTriggerCSharp")]
        public HttpResponseData Run([HttpTrigger(AuthorizationLevel.Function, "get")] HttpRequestData req)
        {
            _logger.LogInformation("C# HTTP trigger function processed a request.");

            var response = req.CreateResponse(HttpStatusCode.OK);
            response.Headers.Add("Content-Type", "text/plain; charset=utf-8");

            response.WriteString($"Welcome to Azure Functions, {req.Query["name"]}!");

            return response;
        }
    }
}
```

## Upgrade your function app in Azure

Upgrading your function app to the isolated model consists of two steps:

1. Change the configuration of the function app to use the isolated model by setting the `FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME` application setting to "dotnet-isolated". Make sure that any deployment automation is similarly updated.
2. Publish your upgraded project to the upgraded function app. 

When you use Visual Studio to publish an isolated worker model project to an existing function app that uses the in-process model, you're prompted to let Visual Studio upgrade the function app during deployment. This accomplishes both steps at once.

If you need to minimize downtime, consider using a [staging slot](functions-deployment-slots.md) to test and verify your upgraded code with your upgraded configuration in Azure. You can then deploy your upgraded app to the production slot through a swap operation.

Once you've completed these steps, your app has been fully migrated to the isolated model. Congratulations! Repeat the steps from this guide as necessary for [any other apps needing migration](#identify-function-apps-to-upgrade).
