# Quickstart: Create a JavaScript function in Azure from the command line

In this article, you use command-line tools to create a JavaScript function that responds to HTTP requests. After testing the code locally, you deploy it to the serverless environment of Azure Functions.

[!INCLUDE [functions-nodejs-model-pivot-description](../../includes/functions-nodejs-model-pivot-description.md)]

Completion of this quickstart incurs a small cost of a few USD cents or less in your Azure account.

There's also a [Visual Studio Code-based version](create-first-function-vs-code-node.md) of this article.

## Configure your local environment

Before you begin, you must have the following prerequisites:

+ An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?ref=microsoft.com&utm_source=microsoft.com&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=visualstudio).

+ One of the following tools for creating Azure resources:

    + [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) version 2.4 or later.

    + The Azure [Az PowerShell module](/powershell/azure/install-azure-powershell) version 5.9.0 or later.

::: zone pivot="nodejs-model-v3" 
+ [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version 14 or above. 
::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="nodejs-model-v4" 
+ [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version 18 or above. 
::: zone-end

[!INCLUDE [functions-install-core-tools](../../includes/functions-install-core-tools.md)]

::: zone pivot="nodejs-model-v4" 
+ Make sure you install version v4.0.5382 of the Core Tools, or a later version.  
::: zone-end

## Create a local function project

In Azure Functions, a function project is a container for one or more individual functions that each responds to a specific trigger. All functions in a project share the same local and hosting configurations. In this section, you create a function project that contains a single function.

::: zone pivot="nodejs-model-v3" 
1. In a suitable folder, run the [`func init`](functions-core-tools-reference.md#func-init) command, as follows, to create a JavaScript Node.js v3 project in the current folder:

    ```console
    func init --javascript --model V3
    ```
    This folder now contains various files for the project, including configurations files named [local.settings.json](functions-develop-local.md#local-settings-file) and [host.json](functions-host-json.md). Because *local.settings.json* can contain secrets downloaded from Azure, the file is excluded from source control by default in the *.gitignore* file.

1. Add a function to your project by using the following command, where the `--name` argument is the unique name of your function (HttpExample) and the `--template` argument specifies the function's trigger (HTTP).

    ```console
    func new --name HttpExample --template "HTTP trigger" --authlevel "anonymous"
    ```

     [`func new`](functions-core-tools-reference.md#func-new)  creates a subfolder matching the function name that contains a code file appropriate to the project's chosen language and a configuration file named *function.json*.

You may find the [Azure Functions Core Tools reference](functions-core-tools-reference.md) helpful.

### (Optional) Examine the file contents

If desired, you can skip to [Run the function locally](#run-the-function-locally) and examine the file contents later.

#### index.js

*index.js* exports a function that's triggered according to the configuration in *function.json*.

:::code language="javascript" source="~/functions-quickstart-templates/Functions.Templates/Templates/HttpTrigger-JavaScript/index.js":::

For an HTTP trigger, the function receives request data in the variable `req` as defined in *function.json*. The response is defined as `res` in *function.json* and can be accessed using `context.res`. To learn more, see [Azure Functions HTTP triggers and bindings](./functions-bindings-http-webhook.md?tabs=javascript).

#### function.json

*function.json* is a configuration file that defines the input and output `bindings` for the function, including the trigger type.

:::code language="json" source="~/functions-quickstart-templates/Functions.Templates/Templates/HttpTrigger-JavaScript/function.json":::

Each binding requires a direction, a type, and a unique name. The HTTP trigger has an input binding of type [`httpTrigger`](functions-bindings-http-webhook-trigger.md) and output binding of type [`http`](functions-bindings-http-webhook-output.md).

1. In a suitable folder, run the [`func init`](functions-core-tools-reference.md#func-init) command, as follows, to create a JavaScript Node.js v4 project in the current folder:

    ```console
    func init --javascript
    ```

  This folder now contains various files for the project, including configurations files named *local.settings.json* and *host.json*. Because *local.settings.json* can contain secrets downloaded from Azure, the file is excluded from source control by default in the *.gitignore* file. Required npm packages are also installed in *node_modules*. 

1. Add a function to your project by using the following command, where the `--name` argument is the unique name of your function (HttpExample) and the `--template` argument specifies the function's trigger (HTTP).

    ```console
    func new --name HttpExample --template "HTTP trigger" --authlevel "anonymous" 

    [`func new`](functions-core-tools-reference.md#func-new) creates a file named *HttpExample.js* in the *src/functions* directory, which contains your function's code. 

4. Add Azure Storage connection information in *local.settings.json*. 
    ```json
    {
        "Values": {       
            "AzureWebJobsStorage": "<Azure Storage connection information>",
            "FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME": "node"
        }
    }
    ```

5. (Optional) If you want to learn more about a particular function, say HTTP trigger, you can run the following command:

    ```console
    func help httptrigger
    ```
::: zone-end 

[!INCLUDE [functions-run-function-test-local-cli](../../includes/functions-run-function-test-local-cli.md)]

[!INCLUDE [functions-create-azure-resources-cli](../../includes/functions-create-azure-resources-cli.md)]

4. Create the function app in Azure:

    # [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

    ```azurecli
    az functionapp create --resource-group AzureFunctionsQuickstart-rg --consumption-plan-location <REGION> --runtime node --runtime-version 18 --functions-version 4 --name <APP_NAME> --storage-account <STORAGE_NAME>
    ```

    The [az functionapp create](/cli/azure/functionapp#az-functionapp-create) command creates the function app in Azure. It's recommended that you use the latest LTS version of Node.js, which is currently 18. You can specify the version by setting `--runtime-version` to `18`.

    # [Azure PowerShell](#tab/azure-powershell)

    ```azurepowershell
    New-AzFunctionApp -Name <APP_NAME> -ResourceGroupName AzureFunctionsQuickstart-rg -StorageAccount <STORAGE_NAME> -Runtime node -RuntimeVersion 18 -FunctionsVersion 4 -Location <REGION>
    ```

    The [New-AzFunctionApp](/powershell/module/az.functions/new-azfunctionapp) cmdlet creates the function app in Azure. It's recommended that you use the latest LTS version of Node.js, which is currently 18. You can specify the version by setting `--runtime-version` to `18`.

    ---

    In the previous example, replace `<STORAGE_NAME>` with the name of the account you used in the previous step, and replace `<APP_NAME>` with a globally unique name appropriate to you. The `<APP_NAME>` is also the default DNS domain for the function app.

    This command creates a function app running in your specified language runtime under the [Azure Functions Consumption Plan](consumption-plan.md), which is free for the amount of usage you incur here. The command also creates an associated Azure Application Insights instance in the same resource group, with which you can monitor your function app and view logs. For more information, see [Monitor Azure Functions](functions-monitoring.md). The instance incurs no costs until you activate it.
